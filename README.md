Open and Closed Principle

The Open-Closed principle states that code should be "Open for extension" and "Closed for modification".

The Open Close Principle encourages software developers to design and write code in a fashion that adding new functionality would involve minimal changes to existing code. Most changes will be handled as new methods and new classes.
